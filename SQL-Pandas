# SQL â†” pandas Cheat Sheet

## SELECT
SQL:
```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table;

df[["column1", "column2"]]

WHERE
SELECT * FROM table WHERE column1 > 10;

df[df["column1"] > 10]


You can then open it in **VS Code, Jupyter, or any Markdown editor**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Jupyter Notebook
- Create a `.ipynb` notebook.  
- Store the **SQL query in a Markdown cell** and the **pandas equivalent in a code cell**.  
- You can even **run the pandas examples** live on a dummy dataset.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Notion / Obsidian
- Paste the cheat sheet into a Notion page or Obsidian note.  
- Tag it (e.g., `#sql`, `#pandas`, `#cheatsheet`).  
- Easy to search later.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 4. PDF / OneNote
- Save as a **PDF cheatsheet** (Markdown â†’ export as PDF).  
- Or copy into **OneNote** if you like organizing into notebooks.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 5. GitHub Gist
- Store the cheat sheet as a **public or private gist** (`cheatsheet.md`).  
- Then you can share or revisit it easily online.  

---

âš¡ **Best choice if you want both readability + reusability:**  
ðŸ‘‰ Markdown + Jupyter Notebook (you get the best of both documentation + executable code).  

---

Would you like me to **format the SQL â†” pandas list you asked for earlier as a clean Markdown cheat sheet** so you can just copy-paste and save it?
